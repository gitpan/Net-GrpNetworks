Net::GrpNetworks.pm - Determine in which network group a IP belongs.


I wrote Net::GrpNetworks to create network groups and allow researching
for specific IPs, discovering in which network group each IP belongs to.
It is quite easy to use and really very fast!

This is an early draft and has not received exhaustive testing, but it
seems to mostly work ok. There are many features that were not developed
but could, and that would improve the code in many aspects. I will try
to maintain compatibility with the public interface in case future 
versions are developed.

Installation: unzip and untar the distribution and move into its
directory. Then the usual

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install
