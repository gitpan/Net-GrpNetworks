Net::GrpNetworks.pm - Determine in which network group a IP belongs.


I wrote Net::GrpNetworks to creates network group and allows that, 
later, we can research for certain IPs to discover in which network 
group that IP belongs. It is easy to use and very fast! 

This is an early draft and has not received exhaustive testing, but it
seems to mostly work ok. There are a several features that it
doesn't have but should, and the code could be improved in a few
places. I will try to maintain compatibility of the public interface
if there are future versions.

Installation: unzip and untar the distribution and move into its
directory. Then the usual

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install
